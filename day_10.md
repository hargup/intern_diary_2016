Hi,

I was searching for Flash usage statistics and I came across this interesting
website called OccupyFlash, their Manifesto say

"**Flash Player is dead.** Its time has passed. It's buggy. It crashes a lot.
It requires constant security updates. It doesn't work on most mobile devices.
It's a fossil, left over from the era of closed standards and unilateral
corporate control of web technology. Websites that rely on Flash present a
completely inconsistent (and often unusable) experience for fast-growing
percentage of the users who don't use a desktop browser. It introduces some
scary security and privacy issues by way of Flash cookies. Flash makes the web
less accessible. At this point, it's holding back the web."

BTW Flash is really dying, the percentage of websites using Flash has gone down
from something like 50% in 2011 to 18% in 2016 [1]. Anyway EME shouldn't be the
answer for Flash, but it is likely that it'll be the case :(.

Another thing I discovered today is that Article 27.2 of Universal Declaration
of Human Rights (UDHR) says 

    "Everyone has the right to the protection of the
    moral and material  interests resulting from any scientific, literary or
    artistic production  of which he is the author."

, which probably mean that IPR
is a human right under UDHR. Though section 27.1 says 

    "Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the
    community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its
    benefits."

which can be contradictory to 27.2 in many cases. Udbhav told me that there is
a big debate at WIPO regarding IP as human right [2] [3], I'll check it out
sometime soon. IP is a very commercial provision used mainly by big corporates,
I wonder why should that be a human right?
