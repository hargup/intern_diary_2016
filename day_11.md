Hi,

Yesterday there was a meeting in the office regarding the smart cities project.
Few people from the [FieldsOfView](http://fieldsofview.in) came in and there
were few other people who's affiliation I don't remember. They talked about the
various schemes that are coming up, the cities which are involved, the people
who are involved and overall impact and concerns with the project. One guys who
works for a organization working for people in slums are fairly concerned about
the inclusively of the smart cities project. Another point of concern is Public
Private Partnerships which are being used to give away power from the
publicly elected system to the private bodies.

Then in the evening we had people from Kashmir talking about the impact of
surveillance and censorship on local Kashmiri population. I need to write about
this in more detail. In the mean time enjoy cartoon from Mir Suhail who was
also here. https://www.facebook.com/mirsuhailcartoonist/
