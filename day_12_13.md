Hi,

Not much happened in these two day so writing the diary for it together. Rather
I'm writing this diary on Sunday after the conference. I really should be more
disciplined and finish off the diary before I leave the office. Anyway I spent
the day organizing the notes into themes and reading more mails from the
mailing list. One very curious thing I found is that Mark Watson himself
recognized that GPLv3 based browsers will be incompatible with EME and he
talked about it on the mailing list. I'm yet to see the reaction of FOSS people
on GPL on W3C. I've read some of the discussion on the bug tracker and the
working group was like "why should we care about GPL software?"

I need to more faster also I'll probably get some other project to work on in
parallel because it gets kinda boring reading so many conversations get kinda
boring.
