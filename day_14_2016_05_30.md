Hi,

Yesterday I reached the office pretty late. I spent the weekend attending a
conference on [Open Access and IP at NLS
Bangalore](http://consilience-nls.com/). Like other conferences I've attended I
really liked it, lot of people, lots of conversations and many new ideas.

I continued the making notes of the mailing list. They were discussion if the
requirements of walled gardens like SmartTVs shouldn't be considered by the
working group. One important point Mark Watson brought up was the IPR regime
won't allow the full specification of the CDMs also it would be hard to CDM
specification which can be implemented in a royalty free manner due to patents
on it. But if this is the EME shouldn't be a part of W3C at all, find someother
platform and set a standard.

Anyway another goal of this project is to create a W3C participation handbook.
I'll start working on it and will look at the EME debate sometime later.
