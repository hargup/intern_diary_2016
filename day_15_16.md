Hi,

In these two days I wrote a small handbook for CIS to help them participate in
W3C, this was part of my research proposal. There are not of areas of W3C in which CIS
will be interested to contribute to which includes accessibility, privacy and
internationalization. The membership fee for isn't high either it is 1905 USD a
year, which I think is quite affordable.
