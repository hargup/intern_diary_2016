Yesterday Sunil was here after a long time, he skimmed though my work and has
asked to give an interim presentation on it today at 4:30. I've also started
with the OpenSocial work Pranesh wants me to do. He has sent me a few papers on
Interoperability and their necessity, and I've also started with Hal Varian and
Carl Shapiro's book "The Economics of Information Technology: An Introduction".
