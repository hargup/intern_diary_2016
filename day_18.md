On friday I had to give an interim presentation on the work that I had done. It
went well. One good thing suggested by Sunil is that I don't need to finish
reading up all the mailing list conversation, that'll take up months and
nothing will come out of it. There are interesting things to study in the notes
that I've taken so far I should write a report on that. Before I "finish" this
project there are two additional things I need to complete.
