Hi,

Yesterday I spent reading the two papers suggested to me by Pranesh, both on
the Essential Facilities Doctrine. Through essential Facilities doctrine Courts
have forced companies to share an essential facility with competitor. The first
paper reviewed the major cases of Essential Facilities Doctrine in US and
European context and described how the lost message of the doctrine is set up
synergies that would be otherwise lost without sharing. The second paper talked
about search engines as an essential facility and why the current framework of
antitrust/competition law is not sufficient to tackle various political and
policy issues raised by search engines.
