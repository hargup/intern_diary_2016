Hi,

Today wasn't a particularly productive day, but I guess that's okay. So
currently my job is to write a research proposal. So started off with reading
some of the new developments on the EME draft proposal and I found out that W3C
has decided to go ahead with EME and they couldn't reach a consensus on DMCA
covenant proposed by EFF. I also skimmed through the discussions on the github
issue tracker on the draft proposal. [1][2][3][4] While going through I was thinking about
what should be my research questions? Should I focus on EME? Should I focus on
W3C how it behaves as a standard setting organization and how it "should"
behave? A chat with Udbhav (another intern from NUJS) cleared things up. He was
present yesterday when I was talking with Sunil about project and we concluded
that my aims are two folded and both should go hand in hand. One is to study
EME discussion and do a stakeholder analysis. Basically how EME came about in
2013, who pushed for why they pushed for it, what were the arguments in favour
of, withing W3C who were against it and what arguments they put in and then put
a special emphasis on the Indian stakeholders, i.e., the public and Indian
media companies. In the process I'll figure out how W3C work, and how can some
like CIS or maybe an individual or some company can participate in W3C and make
their voices heard.

In the evening there was an open meeting about the recent draft bill [5] by
"Ministry Of Home Affairs" to regulate the Geo spatial Information and what
should be done about it. A lots of people from outside were here and few people
also joined in using teleconference. There was lot of emphasis on the fact
that the bill is being presented as National Security Bill and we should be
careful to not to project us as Anti-National.
