Hi,

I've been really unproductive lately. I don't see the EME project moving much
and I want to wrap it up soon. I'm creating a report on that and I want to
finish it tomorrow, for the report I'm presenting a comparison of EME with
other standards and this EME is a potato in the name of a specification, as in
the most important thing CDMs (Content Decryption Module) is not specified and
the specification cannot be evaluated without that.

BTW on side I've started collecting data on OpenSocial. I came across a
presentation from 2010 by a german developer and it showed wide scale adaption
of it [1]. The graph of slide 30 show so many social networks and now it is
only Facebook. The Network Effort promotes monopolies and it is important to
promote interoperability to counter that.

Today I also read a chapter of Arul's book, "Piracy in the Indian Film
Industry". One interesting book referred there is "Cultures and Organizations:
Software of the Mind", the book summarises emperical studies done on different
cultures and classifies them on five dimensions, power distance, collectivism
vs individualism, feminity vs masculanity, uncertaintly avoidance and long term
orientation vs short term orientation.
