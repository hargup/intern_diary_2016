Hi,

Wednesday 13 June 2016

Today I was collecting more data on the OpenSocial project and things haven't
been very good for it. In 2010-11 it was thriving, there were more than 20
social networks using OpenSocial and more than 800 million users but then it
died. One big reason for that is Facebook and it got too big, but I don't think
that's the only reason. In 2014 it moved to W3C and things didn't improve much
either. In October 2015 project Apache Shiding, which was reference
implementation of OpenSocial was shutdown due to inactivity and in Jan 2016
Apache Rave was shutdown because of inactivity.
