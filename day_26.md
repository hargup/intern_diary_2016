Hi,

Today I looked the details of the SoLiD project: Social Linked Data [1]. The
project aims to provide decentralization at three levels, identity, data and
applications and provide api to that. For identity it users WebID [2], I found
to pretty cool. The WebID from the provider installs a certificate in your
browser which you can use to authenticate yourself, it uses no password. They
have also been experimenting with authenticate using a crypto stick. At the
moment passwords are the weakest point in the security infrastruces and we need
get away from them.
