Hi,

I didn't write a diary for both Friday and Monday. The internship in almost
ending I need to finish things up. Sometimes I feel I'm so unproductive, and
often I am unproductive. But sometimes I feel I have too high exceptions from
myself. Today I reviewed the DMCA 1201 and 1202, the sections which specifies
the US DRM laws. In summary according to Section 1201 "no one shall
manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide or otherwise traffic in any
technology, product, service, device, component, or part" that is primarily
designed to circumvent DRM, has no other use than circumventing DRM or is
marked saying that it helps in circumventing DRM. The law does have exception
for reverse engineering, it also has exception for encryption research, but the
exception is very narrow. The researcher has to make a "good faith effort" to
obtain an authorization, I don't know from whom, has to establish that
circumvention was necessary for research and has to be remain careful while
disseminating the research output such that it doesn't lead to infringement.
There is also an exception for circumvention to protect private information but
it is practically evocable because it says that it should no effect on the
ability of the person to gain access to the copyrighted work. So when you are
circumventing DRM you just have to circumvent the part which collects your
private information nothing else.
