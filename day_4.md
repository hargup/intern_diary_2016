Found this github project [BigBang](https://github.com/sbenthall/bigbang) which
has tools to analyze online collaborative communities, it has also tools to
download mailman mailing lists archives and github archives.

I started [reading the mailing list](notes_from_mailing_list.md) there was a
big heated discussion on the formal objection to EME from EFF, the people
supporting the formal objection appeared to be hetrogeneous, many were
independent developers and don't work for big name, one them Tab Atkins works
for Google. On the side the most vocal voice was of John Foliot, who is an
accessibility strategist from W3C. I've summarized most of the points from the
both the sides in my blog, a new thing which needs to be though about is that
EME is already a de facto standard, most of the major browsers already support
it. Having EME under W3C will only help to control and contain it. Pranesh's
opinion on the issue was if EME has to remain a standard, let it be, I don't
want W3C to get involved in it.
