Hi,

19th May 2016

So yesterday again I spent most of my time reading the mailing list
conversation on EME from Feb 2016, the thread is really long and you should
check out [my notes](notes_from_mailing_list.md).

CIS has a nice tradition here, whenever some goes or comes in, we cut a cake
for them. Yesterday was the last day for Anisha and Udbhav. Anisha studied
various big data policies by the government and Udbhav did a lots of things
helping them set up servers, writing comments on ICANN's By Law and studying a
community wifi project that is taking place in Kerela.

There was a heavy rain in the evening so we all stayed up till late in the
office and then went for a dinner Vietnamese place nearby. There Pranesh was
telling me about the [Open Social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSocial)
project which was lauched in ~2008 to create a protocol to add interoperability
amoung various online social networking websites. Then it was "kinda" killed by
Facebook and in 2014 the work resumed and it was moved to W3C. He said it'll be
cool project to track its history, where it came from, where it is now and
where it is going.
