Hi

20th May

Nothing special today, two interns left, Meera and Nayantara and another Meera
joined in. I continued the work, I need to change my strategy, on Monday I'll
do an analysis of how many mails about EME are there, how many people posted
and what are the time frames, things are not gonna work the current way.
