Hi,

23rd May 2016

I tried to analyze how mails were sent to the public-html mailing list
regarding EME and the answer if 495!. To come with the number I used BigBang
which gave me all the all the conversations in Pandas time series data frame
and then I filtered all the messages which has "EME", "DRM" or "Encrypted
Media" in the subject line and simply counted them. Well the good news is that
134 of these messages were sent between Feburary 21st to Feburary 28th, which I
have already read. So, 1/4 th of my job is over.

One thing I really need to improve upon is my grammar, often I've sent
ungrammatical messages on the chat, which has some or other word missing. Not
body has pointed these things out as such but it is embarrassing at times.

BTW I've started classifying the debate into various themes, I'll first finish
it for the part I've read and then I'll continue it for the rest the
conversations.
