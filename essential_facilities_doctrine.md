The paper "The Essential Facilities Doctrine: The lost message of Terminal Railroad" argues that the core of message of the doctrine is to establish healthy synergies instead of reducing the market power of monopolist. They start with discussing various case laws in US and European context and then sets out principles where sharing is forced by the court.

# Synergy Principles

1. Sharing the facility would create synergies by

    a. improving the quality of the members producets, or reducing the industry unit cost of producing them, while

    b. not raisng the defendent owner's cost or restricting its ability to
produce.

2. Sharing can be structured to avoid cartelization in a way that
    a. makes consumers better off than they would be without sharing, and
    b. preserves teh incentive to invest in the facility in the first place.

3. The defendant-owner has nevertheless refused to share.
