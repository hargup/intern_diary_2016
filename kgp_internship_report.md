# Introduction and Motivation

The arrival of internet and digital technologies have made it is very easy and
cheap to create perfect copies of digital media. This has produced serious
difficulties to produce and distribute media using the pre internet era
business models. To continue with their old ways media companies have tried to
make it hard for people to make copies of digital media and working with
hardware manufacturers and software platform providers they have various types
of copy restrictions in hardware and software that is used to play the media.
These technologies are largely known as Digital Rights Management or Digital
Restriction Management or simply DRM. DRMs have remained controversial since
their inception, by media companies DRM is seen as something essential to
preserve their business models and continue operating profitably whereas many
digital rights activist see DRM as something fundamentally opposed to user’s
ability to own and control their devices. DRM also opens up serious issues
regarding serious issues Modern DRM usually works by storing and transmitting
the media in encrypted formats which is usually decrypted only while the
playing or rending of the media on end user’s devices. On the world wide web
the existing way use DRM for videos is through party plugins like Adobe’s Flash
Player and Microsoft silverlight. There is an ongoing draft proposal by W3C to
standardize this in HTML5 with a standard called Encrypted Media
Enhancements(EME). EME too has remained controversial since 2013 when the work
on the standard started.

The aim of my study during the internship was two fold:

* Study the debate that happened about EME, and identify if any better standard
  could have been prepared.

* Figure out if the interests of all the stakeholders were well represented at W3C.

# DETAILED METHODOLOGY / TRAINING

(Step by step procedures / methods to solve the problem should be introduced. A
complete description of the technique to solve the problem should be included
here. This may contain maximum of 4 pages)

In the early stages of the research I read all emails sent between 21st
February 2012 to 1st March 2012 about EME on the public-html mailing list.
There were more 100 such emails discussing the various aspects of the purposed
EME standard. Then I identified major themes of the discussion and the several
alternatives to EME that were proposed.

In the next stage, I evaluated the proposed standards on six dimensions
identified in the discussion. These are

* technical copy protection

* legal copy protection

* interoperability and entry barriers for browsers

* accessibility

* privacy of the user

* security of user’s system.



## Stakeholder Analysis Methodology

Any emails with ` EME `, `Encrypted Media` or `Digital Rights Managagement` in
the subject line is considered to about EME. Then each of the participant is
categorized on the basis of region of the world they belong to and their
employeer's interest to the debate.

### Region Categories

* Asia

* Australia and New Zealand

* Europe

* Africa

* North America

* South America



### Region Methodology

* Look up their personal website and social media accounts (Twitter, LinkedIn,
  Github) and see if it mentions the country they live in. (Works in Most of the cases)

* If the person's email has uses a country specific top level domain, assume that as the country

* If github profile is available look up the timezone on last 5 commits.

* For people who have moved from their home country consider the country where they live now.


# Work Categories

* Foss Browser Developer

* Content Provider

* DRM platform provider

* Accessibility

* Security Researcher

* Other W3C Empoyee

* Privacy

* None of the above


### Work Methodology

* Look up their personal website and social media accounts (Twitter, LinkedIn, Github) and see if it mentions the employer and categorize accordingly.

* People who work on Accessibility, Privacy or Security but also fit into first three categories are categorized in one of the first three categories. For example someone who works on privacy in Google will be placed in "DRM platform provider" instead of "Privacy".

* If no other category can be assigned, then assign "None of the Above"

# Knowledge/Skills Acquired

During the summer internship I developed an understanding of how video
technologies on the web works, how DRM technologies work and largely how
standard for the web are developed.

# Results And Discussion

(Main results with the help of experimental set-up or photos or plots or other
graphical tools should be listed here. A detailed discussion of these should be
presented. This may contain maximum of 4 pages.)


# Summary Of The Outcome

(Summary of the summer intern should be presented here. It should be mentioned
clearly what is developed and if there are any confidentiality issues with regard to
knowledge sharing. In case if some data cannot be made part of this report and needs to
be verified, necessary details of the person in-charge from whom this data can be
verified should also be included.)
