 1. The principle of subsidiarity 2. Diversity 3. War on
metawork 4. Amorphous institutional boundaries. While explaining principle of
subsidiarity Sunil quoted someone and said "anything which can be done should
be done at the lowest level", then he quoted Gandhi saying that the decisions
which can be made at Panchayat level should be made at Panchayat level. By that
he meant that if there is some project that you think you can take up, then
take it up and it can be anything which can produce a research output, you
don't need to ask for permission and you can also get a budget upto 5K rupees.
For example, at guy here is doing a project where orders food online from
different stores, weight the plastic used for packing the food and then using
the estimates of market size etc he will calculate amount of trash it will
generate in 5 yrs to fill up the land fills in Bangalore and CIS bears the cost
of food he orders. The second is point is basically about the fact that CIS
doesn't usually have an institutional position on things because people
internally disagree on things and this is a feature of the organization,
