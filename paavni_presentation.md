Zero Rating
===========

Andriat, Association for progressive communication

    * Because there is market, zero rating should be allowed

Nanabi, advisory council member of CC
    * Some access is better than no access

Priya Shetty
    * It should not be straight jacket. There should be forum deciding ex-ante
      if a particular zero rating should be allowed.

Telcom said
    * They should be allowed to charge extra for OTT

Infrastruce in South Africa works in PPP model


William Stuky, counseller at ICASA

    * OTTs are the reason that Telcos are able to make money through 3G.

Nanabi,
    * Because they are using a public infracture they should serve a public
      function and they shouldn't be able to discriminate.

    * Someone said competitive enviornment is much better.

Alle
    * Look at access instead of net neutrality

William Curry,
    * Should not delay in NN


Telcom
    * Spectrum should be allocated to only 4 players, citing a UK study
