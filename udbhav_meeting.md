There are two parallel goals:

* Study the process of W3C and create a handbook on how CIS or rather anyone
  can participate in W3C.

* Study EME, why is it good or bad, how did it start how did it come to current
  stage, what were the arguments given for and against EME within the W3C, how
does Indian Companies gets affected by EME.

* Were there voices from the civil society within the W3C and were these voices
  heard and how were they reacted upon.

* Interview people in India (media corporations etc on EME, do they plan to use
  it etc)

* How does EFF participate in W3C.
