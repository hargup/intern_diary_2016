Critisim
--------

EME has faced strong crtisism from both inside and outside W3C. The major issues for citisism are implementation issues for FOSS browsers, entry barriers for new browsers, lack of interoperability, concerns about privacy and accessebility and possiblity of legal trouble due to DRM laws in DMCA. Many of these issues arise because of lack of specification of the Content Decryption Modules (CDMs).

* Harry Halpin has pleadged to resign if W3C accepts EME as an official
  recommendation. [1]

* EFF has submitted formal objection against EME and Cory Doctorow has
  published a series of blog posts against EME.

* FSF had called for a world wide protest, in March 2016 they marched chanting
  "rm drm" [2]
